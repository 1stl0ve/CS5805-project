**CS 5805: Machine Learning Final Project**

Pranesh Ambokar, Mohammad Heydari, Roshan Ravindran, and Leo St. Amour

## Overview

This project analyzes and compares the performance characteristics and prediction accuracy trade-offs of linear regression and long short-term memory (LSTM) when applied to stock market prediction.
We train the models using historical stock data and ask them to predict a stock's closing price given its opening, low, and high prices.
